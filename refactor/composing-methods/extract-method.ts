// Problem
// You have a code fragment that can be grouped together.

printOwing(): void {
  printBanner();

  // Print details.
  console.log("name: " + name);
  console.log("amount: " + getOutstanding());
}

// Solution
// Move this code to a separate new method (or function) and replace the old code with a call to the method.

printOwing(): void {
  printBanner();
  printDetails(getOutstanding());
}

printDetails(outstanding: number): void {
  console.log("name: " + name);
  console.log("amount: " + outstanding);
}

### Why Refactor

The more lines found in a method, the harder it's to figure out what the
method does. This is the main reason for this refactoring.

Besides eliminating rough edges in your code, extracting methods is also
a step in many other refactoring approaches.


### How to Refactor

1.  Create a new method and name it in a way that makes its purpose
    self-evident.

2.  Copy the relevant code fragment to your new method. Delete the
    fragment from its old location and put a call for the new method
    there instead.

    Find all variables used in this code fragment. If they're declared
    inside the fragment and not used outside of it, simply leave them
    unchanged---they'll become local variables for the new method.

3.  If the variables are declared prior to the code that you're
    extracting, you will need to pass these variables to the parameters
    of your new method in order to use the values previously contained
    in them. Sometimes it's easier to get rid of these variables by
    resorting to [Replace Temp with Query](/replace-temp-with-query).

4.  If you see that a local variable changes in your extracted code in
    some way, this may mean that this changed value will be needed later
    in your main method. Double-check! And if this is indeed the case,
    return the value of this variable to the main method to keep
    everything functioning.
